# Open 3D Engine Special Interest Group for Core Systems (SIG Core)

This repository holds materials for the Open 3D Engine Foundation Special Interest Group for Core Systems (SIG-Core).

## Description of SIG Core
We manage the Core Systems needed by O3DE and its libraries to fulfill the engines requirements. The SIG primarily owns low-level systems such as memory management, application startup and file input/output. See the [SIG's charter](governance/SIG%20Core%20Charter.md) for full details.

## What the SIG does:

* Contributes changes to O3DE Core Systems in the libraries of AzCore, AzFramework, AzToolsFramework, etc...  
* Collaborate with SIG-Simulation for changes to the Math library and Tick System. 
* Collaborate with SIG-Platform for implementation of low level systems(memory management, keyboard/mouse input, file input/output, etc...).  
* Maintains the Gem System and integrations with CMake.  
* Maintains the Unified Game Launcher.  
* Maintains the AZStd C++ standard library layer
* Implements Core features such as the memory management system, reflection system, archive system, virtual filesystem layer, settings registry, etc...  
* Provides support to community for core system topics.  
* Works with other SIGs and the TSC on core systems issues.  
* Publish and maintain [standards and best practices](https://github.com/o3de/sig-core/tree/main/governance).  

## How do I get involved?

* Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/o3de). The SIG has a specific chat channel **#sig-core**.
* Attend any of our public meetings by connecting to the **#sig-core** voice channel on O3DE's Discord server. See the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar) for upcoming meetings and details.
    * SIG-Core hosts a general meeting once a month, to discuss the core systems features, recently contributed work, pending RFCs, and other items of interest to SIG-Core. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Core Meeting** on O3DE calendar. [Meeting agendas](issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Amtg-agenda) are posted in advanced as GitHub issues and anyone can raise issues for discussion.
    * The SIG also meets once per week, on Wednesday at 9:00am PST/PDT(16:00 UTC from 2nd week of March - 1st week of November, 17:00 UTC from 2nd week of November - 1st week of March), to review any new issues of interest to the SIG. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Core Issue Triage** and see the [Triage Guide](TRIAGE_GUIDE.md) for more details of what happens at this meeting.
* Subscribe to the [SIG-Core mailing list](https://lists.o3de.org/g/sig-core), which is used to send out information on the next monthly meeting as well as the meeting agenda.

### Who can attend or participate?
O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #sig-core channel on O3DE Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
